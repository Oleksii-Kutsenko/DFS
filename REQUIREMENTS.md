# Distributed File System Requirements

1. **File Storage**

    - Users can upload files to the distributed file system.
    - Users can retrieve files stored in the distributed file system.
    - Files should be divided into smaller chunks for distribution and storage.

2. **Data Distribution and Partitioning**

    - Data should be distributed across multiple nodes to ensure load balancing.
    - Implement a data partitioning strategy (e.g., consistent hashing) to determine which node should store each chunk of data.

3. **Data Replication and Fault Tolerance**

    - Implement data replication to ensure fault tolerance.
    - Define the replication factor (e.g., 3), indicating how many copies of each chunk should be stored across nodes.
    - Handle the detection and recovery from node failures, ensuring data availability.

4. **Metadata Management**

    - Create a metadata service to manage information about files, such as file names, versions, and access permissions.
    - Metadata should be stored in a centralized or distributed database for easy access and consistency.

5. **Consistency Model**

    - Choose and implement a consistency model for the file system (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency).
    - Ensure that all operations adhere to the chosen consistency model.

6. **Load Balancing**

    - Implement load balancing mechanisms to distribute read and write requests evenly across nodes.
    - Monitor the load on each node and adjust the distribution of requests accordingly.

7. **Authentication and Authorization**

    - Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access files.
    - Define access control lists (ACLs) or permissions to manage file access.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**

    - Set up monitoring tools to track the health and performance of nodes in the distributed file system.
    - Implement logging to record important events and errors for troubleshooting.

9. **Network Communication**

    - Develop a communication protocol for nodes to exchange data and messages.
    - Ensure secure and efficient network communication.

10. **Data Encryption and Security (Optional)**

    - Implement data encryption to protect the confidentiality of files.
    - Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with data.

11. **User Interface (Optional)**

    - Create a user-friendly interface for users to upload, download, and manage their files in the distributed file system.
    - Implement error handling and feedback for users.

12. **Additional Features (Optional)**

    - Snapshots and versioning of files.
    - Support for large files and efficient data streaming.
    - Integration with cloud storage services.
    - Advanced security features such as access auditing and intrusion detection.

13. **Documentation and Testing**

    - Provide comprehensive documentation for setting up and using the distributed file system.
    - Perform extensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and load testing, to ensure system reliability and performance.

14. **Deployment**

    - Develop deployment scripts or Docker configurations for easy deployment and scaling of nodes.

15. **Scalability (Future Consideration)**

    - Consider how the system can be scaled horizontally to accommodate an increasing number of users and files.
